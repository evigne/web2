To scale the WebSocket server to handle a large library, we’ll make several modifications to improve the backend. We’ll implement lazy loading, handle long-running tasks asynchronously using Celery, and introduce concurrent connections to ensure the server remains responsive. Below is the updated WebSocket server architecture.

Steps to Modify the WebSocket Server

1. Install Celery and Redis

Celery will handle long-running tasks asynchronously, and Redis will serve as a message broker for task management.

	1.	Install Celery and Redis:

pip install celery redis


	2.	Install Redis server (if it’s not already installed on your system):
	•	For macOS:

brew install redis


	•	For Linux:

sudo apt-get install redis-server


	•	For Windows, you can install Redis using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

	3.	Start Redis:

redis-server



2. Update WebSocket Server to Use Celery

Here’s the updated be/app.py where we will integrate Celery to handle long-running tasks and lazy-load library modules.

Updated be/app.py:

import asyncio
import websockets
import json
import subprocess
import importlib
from celery import Celery

# Initialize Celery with Redis as the message broker
app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

# Sample task for processing Python code
@app.task
def process_code_task(code):
    # Dynamically import the necessary part of the large library
    try:
        sample_lib = importlib.import_module('samplePyLib.main')  # Lazy loading
        return sample_lib.process_code(code)
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)

async def handle_client(websocket, path):
    while True:
        try:
            # Receive code from frontend
            message = await websocket.recv()
            data = json.loads(message)
            code = data['code']

            # Call Celery task asynchronously
            result = process_code_task.delay(code)  # This returns immediately, result is processed in the background

            # Wait for task completion and get the result (this could be done more asynchronously)
            task_result = result.get(timeout=10)

            # Send the result back to the frontend
            await websocket.send(json.dumps({"result": task_result}))

        except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed:
            print("Connection closed")
            break

# Start the WebSocket server
async def main():
    async with websockets.serve(handle_client, "localhost", 8765):
        await asyncio.Future()  # Run forever

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

Explanation of Changes:

	1.	Celery Task Queue (process_code_task):
	•	The function process_code_task is defined as a Celery task. This allows the WebSocket server to handle the request asynchronously, offloading the task of processing the code to the Celery worker. The task returns immediately, and Celery processes the Python code in the background.
	2.	Lazy Loading (importlib):
	•	The library samplePyLib.main is imported lazily using importlib.import_module. This ensures that the modules are only loaded when needed, optimizing memory usage.
	3.	Redis as Broker:
	•	Redis is used as a broker to communicate between the WebSocket server and Celery tasks. This way, the WebSocket server can remain responsive, handling multiple connections concurrently.

3. Set Up Celery Worker

Now, you need to run the Celery worker that will process the Python code asynchronously.

	1.	Run Celery Worker:
Open a new terminal and run:

celery -A app worker --loglevel=info



This will start a Celery worker that processes the tasks sent by the WebSocket server.

4. Test the WebSocket Server

To test the entire setup:

	1.	Start the WebSocket server:

python app.py


	2.	Start the Angular frontend with Monaco Editor (if you haven’t already):

cd fe/monaco-app
ng serve


	3.	Write Python code in the Monaco Editor on the frontend. The editor will send the code to the WebSocket server, which will process it asynchronously using Celery and respond with the result.

Improvements:

	•	Concurrency: The WebSocket server can handle multiple connections because task processing is offloaded to Celery.
	•	Lazy Loading: The large library is loaded dynamically when required, improving memory efficiency.
	•	Asynchronous Processing: By offloading tasks to Celery, the WebSocket server can quickly respond to multiple clients without getting blocked.
